What Is Ray Tracing? **Specialized hardware for BVH + shading algorithms + neural rendering**

- heterogeneous hardware with tight accelerator

**Basic Steps**

1. Find the closest intersection point
2. Do tree-traversal on Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)

Divergence in ray tracing
---

Ray tracing is massively parallel, but not easily mapped to hardware

- Individual rays have divergent behavior
- Divergence is costly for SIMD processors such as GPUs

**Coherent rays (Primary rays)** = similar origin and direction

### Divergence

As **secondary rays** bounce around the scene, they become incoherent, causing **two types of divergence:**

#### Control Flow Divergence

Some threads in a warp stay inactive.

#### Memory Divergence

Longer memory latency, higher memory traffic.

### Ray Reordering

**Ray reordering/sorting** can restore coherence at the algorithm level

Microarchitectural bottlenecks from divergence
---

**Control flow divergence** in ray tracing causes…

- CUDA: SIMT inefficiencies

**Memory divergence** in ray tracing causes…

- CUDA: Uncoalesced L1 accesses
- RTX: High miss traffic to L2 cache

**Ray sorting** alleviates above bottlenecks

- Benefits both CUDA and RTX kernel
- More improvement on memory divergence than control flow

### Benefits

1. Sorting rays can lower latencies and improve occupancy by 53%
2. Ray sorting reduces divergence and improves trace throughput
3. RTX also benefits from ray sorting, as much as CUDA
    - Scheduling of rays remains important

Discussions
---

- Solving divergence in ray tracing necessitates **algorithm-hardware co-design**
- Open GPU infrastructures e.g. Vortex/Skybox enables **hardware/software co-design** research for ray tracing

Summary
---

- Ray tracing is **latency-bound** than bandwidth-bound
- **Divergence** of individual rays underlies microarchitectural bottlenecks
- **Ray reordering** can relieve divergence by re-distributing work
