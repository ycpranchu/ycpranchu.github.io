A Multi-threaded Linked List

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

### Using One Mutex for Entire List

An obvious solution is to simply lock the list any time that a thread attempts to access it.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
problem - we are serializing access to the list (non-parallelism)
</Callout>

### Using One Mutex per Node

Instead of locking the entire list, we could try 
to lock individual nodes and also the `head_p`.

Much more complex, Frequently use System Call, Increase the Mutex storage

### Using Read-Write Lock

A read-write lock is somewhat like a mutex except that it 
provides two lock functions:

* Locks the read-write lock for reading
* Locks the read-write lock for writing

### Performance of the Various Implementations

Caches, Cache Coherence, and False Sharing
---

Recall - Cache Coherence Problem

### Slow Due to Cache Misses (Write-Misses)

### Slow Due to Cache Coherence (Read-Misses)

This scenario is called `false sharing`.

### False Sharing

Suppose two threads with separate caches access `different variables` that belong to the `same cache line`.

- One thread change its data, `then entire cache line become in_valid`.
- The other need to fetch its data from memory, although the data isn't changed and still in the cache.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Solution: Padding - Use dummy data to `saparate` two data into `different cache lines`.
</Callout>

Thread-Safety
---

A block of code is `thread-safe` if it can be simultaneously executed by multiple threads without causing problems.

### Example: Multithreaded Tokenizers

As an example, suppose we want to use multiple threads to `“tokenize”` a file.

`strtok` caches a pointer to `string`, and for subsequent calls it returns successive tokens taken from the cached copy

Recall that `strtok` caches the input line (string).
> Done by declaring a variable to have static storage class

Unfortunately for us, this cached string is shared, not private. Thus, thread 0’s call to `strtok` with the third line of the input has apparently `overwritten the contents` of thread 1’s call with the second line (string has been modified).
