Parallel Programming L4: Shared-Memory Programming with OpenMP (Part 1)
===

Introduction to OpenMP
---

What is OpenMP?

- Standardizes loop-level & task parallelism.
- Standardizes ~ 20 years of compiler-directed threading experience.

> High-level API (compiler directives 80%)

OpenMP Core Syntax

`#pragma omp construct [clause [clause]…]`

To compile with gcc, we need to include the `–fopenmp` option

```bash
$ gcc –fopenmp –o omp_hello omp_hello.c
```
