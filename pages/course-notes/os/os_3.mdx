Operating System L3: Memory Management
===

Basic Concepts of Memory Management
---

- `Page Frame` - Partition `physical` address space (actual space on DRAM)
- `Page` (Virtual) - Partition `virtual` address space (programmer side)
- Page Frame & Page is `4KB`

Kernel manages all `page frames` and maintains `page tables`.

</Callout>

`Virtual Memory Management` - Let all processes `share the same physical address space` via page tables. (each process thinks they own the whole space)

- VA - Virtual Memory
- TLB - Cache

Physical Memory Management

### Page Frames Management

`Memory Management Unit` (MMU) typically deals in pages

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Each page frame is managed by a struct page structure
</Callout>
> associated with physical pages

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byo6Gphbp.png)

Overhead - 40B for each struct page, 4KB for each page frame, `4GB DRAM - Require Only 40MB `

### Zone

The kernel uses the zones to `group pages of similar properties` (or `hardware characteristics`), three primary zones below:

* `ZONE_NORMAL` - The zone contains normal, regularly mapped, pages.
> ISR, Page table...
* `ZONE_DMA` - Page frames that can undergo `DMA (Direct Memory Access)`.
> Data Buffering
* `ZONE_HIGHMEM` - Some page frames are not permanently mapped into the kernel address space. 
> Use virtual address, not used in 64bit system

### Nodes (CPU-DRAM Pair)

`Uniform Memory Access` (UMA) vs `Non-Uniform Memory Access` (NUMA)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk4vHphWT.png)

Why NUMA?

1. Fast local access
> Avoid data conjunction
2. Higher bandwidth
> More Memory Controller - faster speed, higher cost
3. Easy to scale out
> Just set up more nodes

Maintains a data structure (pg_data_t) `for each NUMA node`

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HylBL62ba.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
All the processes share the same kernel - `only 1 Node`.
</Callout>

Granularity: Nodes -> Zones -> Page Frames

- Allocate memory from the `node closest` to the running CPU.

Physical Memory Allocation
---

Initially, all memory is available and is considered as a large block of `hole`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
System searches the set for a hole that is large enough.
</Callout>

* `First Fit` - Search and allocate the first hole that is big enough.
> Waste Size
* `Best Fit` - Search all holes and allocate the smallest hole, which is big enough.
> Waste Time
* `Worst Fit` - Search all holes and allocate the largest hole.
> Waste Size & Time - But sometimes processes get larger (prevent the content switch & memory allocating time)...

### Fragmentation

* `External Fragmentation` - Enough total memory space to satisfy a request but the `available spaces are not contiguous`.
> Paging can solve this!!
* `Internal Fragmentation` - Occurs when systems split the continuous space into continuous chunks (e.g., page)
> Waste space!! (processes < 4KB)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkdATvkf6.png)

Linux Page Allocation
---

* `alloc_pages()` function allocates a `single page` or `2^order pages` and returns pointer to the first page’s page struct.
> Buddy System
* For more general `byte-sized allocations`, the kernel provides `kmalloc()`.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyqZk03ZT.png)

### Buddy System

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Prevent Internal Fragmentation
</Callout>

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1MbxA3Z6.png)

### Why Slab Layer?

`Grouping kernel objects` (i.e., data structure) into slab caches. `Pre-allocating memory` pages in slabs leading to faster memory allocation.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
When the `data structure` is no longer needed, it is `returned to the free list and modify it instead of deallocated`. 
</Callout>

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJZFm0hba.png)

* The slab layer acts as a `generic data structure-caching layer`
> Frequent allocation and deallocation can result in memory fragmentation.
* Can be made per-processor, so that `no locks are required` for allocation and deallocation.
* Can be `NUMA-aware`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Avoid from allocating and freeing physical address as frequent as possible.
</Callout>

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ6yr02Z6.png)
> Each type of data structure has single cache.

`Structure: Cache -> Slab -> Page`

- Full Lists - All objects on a slab marked as used
- Partial Lists - Slab comprises both used and free objects
- Empty Lists - All objects on a slab marked as free

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1WsHChZp.png)
> processes smaller than 4KB

1. `Run Allocation` - Only when there does not exist any partial or empty slabs in each cache.
2. `Run Free` - Only when available memory grows low.

### Linux Page Allocation

Two common libraries to allocate kernel memory - `kmalloc()` and `vmalloc()`.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJei8A3Wp.png)

#### kmalloc() vs vmalloc()

- The `kmalloc()` function obtains kernel memory in `byte-sized chunks`.
> Note, malloc() in C library is for allocating user space memory

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
If we need a `whole 4KB page`, `alloc_pages()` in prior slides fits better.
</Callout>
> Return a pointer points to a block of memory that is at least the requested size.

- The `vmalloc()` function allocates memory that is `only virtually contiguous`.
> Requires page tables to maintain the mapping between virtual and physical addresses.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Regarding performance, memory allocation inside kernel `usually uses kmalloc()`.
</Callout>
> vmalloc() is used only when systems require large regions of memory.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
If systems can get enough contiguous physical addresses all the time, then nearly `no address translation overhead` (1:1 direct mapping), `like kmalloc()`!
</Callout>

### High Memory

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
On 32-bit system, kernel only has 1GB virtual memory. What if systems have 8GB memory space?
</Callout>

Kernel address space `reserves a 128MB dynamic mapping area`, called `High Memory` (e.g., 896MB ~ nGB) 
> not permanently mapped into the kernel's address space. (Temporarily Mapping)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJcfd0n-T.png)

Usage - file caching, DMA & networking buffers

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
High memory is a hack. We don't need it on 64-bit systems.
</Callout>

Virtual Memory Management
---

On Linux, each process is given a `unique` and `flat` 32 or 64-bit address space.

- **Unique** - Processes can store `different data at the same virtual address` in their `own address space`.
> Threads share address space with their processes.
- **Flat** - Modern Linux system does not use segmentation.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1eTyWIGp.png)
> 32-bit address space - 0 to 2^32^ or 4294967295

Not every address is legal, `intervals of legal addresses` are `memory areas`.
> Permission - readable, writeable, executable

### The Memory Descriptor

Memory descriptor (`struct mm_struct`) is a **kernel data structure** contains all information related to the **process’s address space**.
> Processes access the memory descriptor by **mm field** in the process descriptor.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkipdWLzT.png)

- `mm_users` specifically `counts the number of users` within the same process that are sharing the memory map.
- `mm_count` tracks `references to the memory map`, which can come from multiple processes, threads, or sources.
> mm_count \<\= mm_users, because it's focused on the per-process reference count.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
mm_count increases when system calls
</Callout>

### Virtual Memory Areas (VMA)

The memory area (or VMA) structure (vm_area_struct) describes a single memory area over a `contiguous interval in a given virtual address space`.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryP7T-UMp.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Two VMAs `cannot overlap` with each other. 
</Callout>

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry6bJM8GT.png)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
`Merge two VMAs` if they overlap with each others.
</Callout>

How to create or expand a VMA - `do_mmap()` is the function used to `add an address interval` to a process’s address space.
> Whether that means expanding an existing memory area or creating a new one.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJsgefLzT.png)

Page Tables
---

After CPUs enable `virtual memory management (or MMU)`, all virtual addresses shall be `converted to physical addresses before being accessed`.

* a bunch of 8B page table entries (PTE) on 64-bit systems
* larger Memory, More PTEs
* multi-level page tables. (4-level for 64-bit systems)
* TLB cache prevent frequently looking up a page table

### Page Fault

- `Minor Page Fault` - Page is `already in the memory but is not marked` in the MMU as being loaded in memory.
> e.g. malloc() allocates physical addresses once being touched.
- `Major Page Fault` - Page is `not in the memory`.
> May cause expensive I/O movement costs.

### How the CPU Walks Page Tables

The base address of PGD is maintained in `CPU’s CR3 register`.
> CPU can walk automatically. Or kernel code can also walk it.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyWrbzLzp.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Why `9-bits` - Page Size = 4 KB, could accommodate `512 (9-bits) entries (4 KB / 8 B)`
</Callout>

### Why 4-Level Page Tables for 64-bit System

* Page Size = 4 KB (2^12^ B)
* Virtual Address Space Size = 2^48^ B (48-bit virtual address)
* Page Table Entry Size is 8B

How many levels:

* Last-Level - (2^48^ / 2^12^) * 8 = 2^39^ B ( > 2^12^ B)
* Last 2 Level - (2^39^ / 2^12^) * 8 = 2^30^ B ( > 2^12^ B)
* Last 3 Level - (2^30^ / 2^12^) * 8 = 2^21^ B ( > 2^12^ B)
* Last 4 Level - (2^21^ / 2^12^) * 8 = 2^12^ B ( \<\= 2^12^ B) `= Page Size`

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
`Memory is byte addressable`, so one bit can address one byte
</Callout>

### brk() & mmap()

`brk()` - Adjust the `program's data heap` (segment) by changing the program's break address (modify `vm_end`).
> Malloc() function calls brk() system call usually.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SktiV78Ga.png)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkO4Lm8f6.png)

`mmap()` - Maps files, devices, or other objects into their virtual address space.
