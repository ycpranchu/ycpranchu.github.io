Paging: A Deep Dive

### How to enable MMU

The `MMU is activated` during the system boot process.

CPU runs a `jump command` to execute the virtual address, which points to the next instruction.

### Single-Level Page Table

Single-level page tables map virtual and physical memory one-to-one.

- Not suitable when systems have a large or sparse virtual address space
> Hugh memory consumption
 
- When to use: Systems have `small address spaces` or `when a one-to-one mapping is desirable`.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Caveat: The system needs `2^36 pages * 2^3 = 2^39` continuous pages (or `512GB`) to store a single-level page table.
</Callout>

### Inverted Page Table (Out-dated)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Large memory consumption for storing multi-level page tables.
</Callout>

Single-level and only one page table, PTE = \<process-id, page-number, offset\>

- One entry for each page frame.
- \<process-id page-number\> equals to the function of multi-level tables.
- If a match is found, \<process-id, page-number\> = i, `get physical page (frame)` by \<i, offset\>.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Sorted by the physical addresses.
</Callout>

Disadvantages:

* Shall walk through the whole table if there is no matched.
* One physical page cannot have two shared virtual addresses.

### Huge Page Management

Challenge of using 4KB page size.

* TLB_Reach `(TLB_Size X Page_Size)` - The amount of memory accessible from the TLB. > High TLB Misses
* Page Table Walk - `Up to 4 DRAM accesses` for translating a virtual address.

Huge Page - `Large contiguous` (both virtual and physical) memory chunk.

Q & A
---

Why inverted page table cannot have two shared virtual address?

If a match is found, \<process-id, page-number\> = i, get physical page (frame) by \<i, offset\>. -> `VA can't share the same i index`.

> Solve - extra bit could be set in the page table. (time consuming)
