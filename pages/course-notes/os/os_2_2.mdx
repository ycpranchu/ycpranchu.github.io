Operating System L2: Interrupt
===

Interrupts
* `Software Interrupt` - How system call works. Also, how to implement it.
* `Hardware Interrupt` - How interrupt handler (or interrupt service routine) works.

System Call
---

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Goal - let user-space processes `interact with the operating system`.
</Callout>
> Kernel provides a set of interfaces, called system calls.

e.g. `function calls` defined in the C library

`sys_call_table` - The kernel keeps a list of all `system calls (with System Call Numbers)` in the system call table.

### System Call Handler

How to run system call:

1. Software interrupt call `system call handler`
1. The CPU switches from `user mode to kernel mode` (Not Process Context Switch!!)
1. Execute `code corresponding` to the system call
> It is not possible for user-space applications to execute kernel code directly

### How to Implement a System Call

Brief Procedures:

* Write a new system call (e.g., sys_hello.c)
* Create a Makefile
* Add the new system call into the system call table
    * Parameters: System_call_number, arch(e.g., 64), system_call_name,  program_of_system_call
* Add the new system call to the header file (include/linux/syscalls.h)
* Compile/Install/Update Kernel

### Handling Hardware Events

- `Polling` - Periodically, the kernel checks hardware status and responds accordingly.
> For fast response I/O
- `Interrupt` - Let the hardware to signal to the kernel.
> For slow response I/O

Interrupt (`Asynchronous`, Hardware Interrupts) - Hardware devices `physically produce electronic signals`, which are directed into `input pins on an interrupt controller`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Asynchronous - CPU need to wait I/O.
</Callout>

Exceptions (`Synchronous`, Software Interrupts, No I/O) - Exceptions are `produced by the processor` while executing instructions either in response to a `programming error` (e.g., divide by zero) or `abnormal condition` (e.g., call a system call or a page fault).

### Interrupt Request

`Different devices` can be associated with different interrupts by means of a `unique interrupt value (max: 256)`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Interrupt Request (IRQ) - `Specific interrupt` is associated with a `specific device`, and the `kernel knows this`.
</Callout>

> IRQ 0 => timer interrupt / IRQ 1 => keyboard interrupt

### How an Interrupt Works

How an interrupt works:

* Hardware devices send out an `interrupt signal`.
* The CPU stops current execution.
* The interrupt controller sends `INT #` to the CPU.
* CPU `accesses the Interrupt Vector Table` by `INT # * 4(bit)`
* The CPU runs the `interrupt service routine (ISR)` to handle the interrupt.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Why we put Code of ISR in the behind - `ISR doesn't have equal size`.
</Callout>
> ISR pointer is static, ISR code can be dynamic.

### Interrupt Handler

Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) or Interrupt Handler - It is part of a `device driver` (the `kernel code` manages the device)
> Custom defined ISR - find number & code

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Challenge: ISR is non-blockable (Cannot Sleep).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Linux `partiall` supports `Nested Interrupts` 
</Callout>

- `Top Halves` - cannot be interrupted
> **Run immediately** upon receipt of the interrupt and performs only the work that is **time-critical**.
- `Bottom Halves` - can be interrupted by higher priority
> Work that can be **performed later** is **deferred** until the bottom half.

### GPU Context Switch

Key difference: 

- `CPUs support preemptive multitasking`, enabling the operating system to frequently switch betwee tasks.
- `GPUs primarily perform non-preemptive multitasking`, running GPU tasks to completion without preemption.

GPU driver is run on CPU
