### Interaction with the Peripherals

- Port-Mapped I/O (Isolated I/O) - CPU accesses peripherals by `IN/OUT instructions` where the `I/O address space is separated from the memory address space`.
- Memory Mapped I/O - CPU accesses peripherals by `load/store instructions` where the `I/O address space is shared with the memory address space`.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Direct Memory Access (DMA) - `Transfer data` directly between memory and I/O devices `without CPU’s interventions`.
</Callout>

### Kernel I/O Stacks

- Block Devices - `Addressable` in device-specified chunks called blocks and generally support `seeking`, the `random access of data`.
> Mounted as a file system, transferr fixed number of bytes
- Character Device - Providing access to data `only as a stream`, generally of characters (bytes).
> transferr one byte

How to Build a Device Driver
---

Device Driver - A `computer program` that operates or `controls a particular type of device` that is attached to a computer.

- Module_init - Kernel runs a function when the module is `loaded`.
- Module_exit - Kernel runs a function when the module is `removed`.

Source Tree:

- `Store driver code` in the correlated directory
- `Modify the Makefile` in the directory

Build Externally:

### Kernel Programming

Kernel code can `access the global item current`, which has a pointer `points to struct task_struct`.

- Super small stack - the kernel has a very small stack (Only 1~2 pages)
- Kernel function with __ - Low-level components (used with caution)
- Do not use floating points - very expensive in the kernel

Block I/O Layer

### Buffers and Buffer Heads

- Sector - The smallest addressable unit of the `storage device`.
- Block - The smallest addressable unit of the `file system`.
> Size(Page) >= Size(Block) >= Size(Sector)

`Buffer` - The object which represents a block in memory.
> Buffer Head - A descriptor (i.e., struct buffer_head) for each buffer.

### Challenges of Buffer Heads

Buffer heads play the role of `buffer-to-block mapping`.

- Challenge 1 - A large and bulky data structure.
> A block is smaller than a page, and each buffer is described by a `bulky buffer head` (inefficient).
> Sol (2.6 kernel): kernel works directly with pages and address spaces instead of blocks.
- Challenge 2 - kernel shall break up `large block I/O operations` into `multiple needless buffer_head structures`
> Sol (2.5 kernel): A new, flexible, and lightweight container for block I/O operations. (bio) 

### BIO Structure

This structure represents `block I/O operations that are in flight`  (active) as a list of segments.
> Segment: A chunk of a `buffer that is contiguous` in memory.

### Optimization on I/O Schedulers

Request Queues - Store pending (待辦) block I/O requests

Challenges - `Simply sending` out requests to the block devices `in the order` that the kernel issues them, results in `poor performance`.
> Sol: Merging and sorting of pending requests in the queue.

I/O Schedulers - `Decides the order` of requests in the queue and `at what time each request is dispatched` to the block device.

- Merging - coalescing of two or more requests into one.
- The entire request queue is kept sorted, sectorwise.
> Minimize all seeking by `keeping the disk head moving in a straight line`.
