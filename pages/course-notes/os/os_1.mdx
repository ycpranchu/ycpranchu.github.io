Operating System L1: Recap
===

Three basic components:

* `Computing devices`
* `Memory devices` (e.g. DRAM)
* `I/O devices` (e.g. HDD, SDD, or network devices)

Von-Neumann Architecture:

1. CPU `fetches` an instruction from memory.
2. Then, CPU `decodes and executes` the instruction.
3. CPU fetches next data (`Automatically Increment PC`).

    `Challenges` without Operating Systems:
</Callout>

* CPU will be solely occupied by one process.
> Process Scheduler
* CPU shall wait for I/O devices. (1 ns vs 100 us).
> Page Fault Handler & Context Switch
* CPU cannot understand ”file” in I/O devices.
> Device Driver & File System

What is Operating Systems
---

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
The role of an OS is to `coordinate` and manage `hardware devices`.
</Callout>

* Transparency - Users do not need to worry about `hardware managements or contentions`.
* Resource Allocator - `Manage` CPU time, memory space and I/O resources.
* Control Program - `Prevent errors` and improper use of computers. `(permission control)`

Well-Known Components:

* `Process Scheduler` - Fairly allocate CPU resources to applications.
* `Memory Manager` - Allocate memory, locate pages, reclaim memory.
* `Block I/O Layer` - Manage I/O requests (Merge & Schedule I/O)
* `File System` - Locate file contents, partition devices, control permission.

What is Kernel
---

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Linux Kernel - A process manager consists of a `bunch of C and Assembly code`.
</Callout>

Each process shall have their own `virtual address space (1GB | 3GB)`.
> If physical memory -> hard to programming

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Is Linux Kernel a Process: No, `Context-Switch expensive`
</Callout>

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkttE6Slp.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Kernel runs as `part of a user process`.
</Callout>
> Noting: A specific part of all processes' virtual address space points to the same physical address storing kernel code. 

- `Direct mapping`

`Just switch pointer` (User mode to Kernel mode, without context switching).

### How to Trigger/Request Kernel Services

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
`Only` when some `special events are triggered`.
</Callout>

Hardware interrupts - `alert signal`

- Timer interrupt
- I/O Interrupt

Software-generated interrupts - `Traps or Exceptions`

- Specific requests from user processes (`System Call, such as Read/Write`)
> Program Library
- Some errors (e.g. invalid memory access or `page faults`)

### A High-Level Overview

`Libraries` (e.g., C/C++ Library -> Do Memory Allocation): `User System Calls`

## System Trend

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
`Latency` - for `single` user
</Callout>

* The device trend `blurs the boundary` between memory and storage.
* `Storage response time` catches up with `context switch overhead` (1~10 us).
> CPU don't need to wait
* The `overhead` of running `file system` becomes critical (e.g., page cache).
* Huge memory demands increases deployment cost. (Right page size?)
> Problem - large page table
