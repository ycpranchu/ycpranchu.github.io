L5: File System & Virtual Filesystem
===

Filesystem - `Method` and `data structure` that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved.
> Without it, data will be one large body on storage media (Hard to separate and identify).

- Disk-based filesystems - Storing files on `non-volatile block-oriented` media.
- Network filesystems - Carried out over a network connection.

Filesystem – File and Directories
---

File - a linear array of bytes that can be read/written

- Each file has a `low-level name` (or `inode number`) that `uniquely identifies` itself.
> Each directory (`special type of file` with specific content) has an inode number as well.

For Linux, `no difference` between files and directories.

Filesystem – More Details
---

File Descriptor - An integer to identify the `open file` in all file-related operations.
> Assigned by the kernel `when a file is opened` and is valid only `within a process`.

Inode - Each file (or directory) has their own inode.
> `Contains metadata` such as access rights, date, pointers to the file data.

- Soft Links - A separate file (called shortcut) `contains a path or reference` to the target file or directory. (捷徑)
- Hard Links - `The file shares` all the attributes of the original file, `even the inode number`. (Copy)

Log-Structure File System
---

Sequential Accesses - Write data in a `sequential order is not enough`. May still suffer from a lot of `contiguous writes`.

- Write Buffering - `Buffer all updates` and write a bunch of data `to a disk in a batch`.

> Inode Map (Inode# → Address) - Can track each inode easily and efficiently

- How to find the corresponding inode map

Checkpoint Region - Fixed and known region on the disk. It contains pointers to the `latest pieces of the inode map`.

- What about Directories (/home/test)

A directory is just a collection of (name, inode number) mappings
> A directory like a `file has their own inode`.

- Challenge `without inode map` - recursive update problem

Virtual File System
---

Enables programs to use `standard Unix system calls` to work `regardless` of the filesystem or underlying physical medium (standard interface).
> issue generic system calls to access files via a uniform naming policy on *any filesystem, any storage medium*

### VFS Objects and Data Structures

Four primary object types of VFS:

- *Superblock* Object - Represents a specific `mounted file system`.
- *inode* Object - Represents a `specific file`.
- *dentries* Object - Represents a `directory entry`, which is a single component of a path.
- *File* Object - Represents an `open file` as associated with a process.
> dentry != directory. Directory is just another kind of file.

#### The Superblock Object

Designed to `store information describing the filesystem`.

- When mounted, a FS invokes alloc_super(), `reads its superblock off the disk`, and `fills in its superblock object`.

> FS wanted to write to its superblock, sb → s_op → write_super(sb);

#### The Inode Object

`Represents all the information` needed by the kernel to `manipulate a file`.

- `inode` represents metadata of each file on a FS
- `inode object` (or VFS inode) is constructed in memory only `as files are accessed`

#### The Dentry Object

The `hierarchical nature of a file system` is managed by dentry objects.
> /home/hello/world → Four dentry objects
> 
> The dentry object `does not correspond` to any sort of on-disk data structure.

- Used - Corresponds to a valid inode and is `own by some users`.
- Unused - Corresponds to a valid inode, but does `not belong to any user`.
- Negative - Not associated with inode.

Both `dentry objects` and the `corresponding inodes can be cached` for faster directory lookup and file metadata accesses.

#### The File Object & File Operations

Represent a `file opened by a process`, may have multiple file objects for the same file
> the file object doesn’t correspond to any on-disk data.

Page Cache
---

Page Cache - a disk cache. Minimize disk I/O by `storing (page) data in the main memory`.

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByGRPrHDT.png)

Write Operation:

- Write-Through - Automatically `update both` the in-memory cache and the on-disk file `at the same time`.
> Keeping the page cache and storage `coherent`.
- Write-Back - Backing storage is `not immediately updated`.
> Data can be coalesced and written back in a batch. (periodically writes those `dirty pages` back to the storage device)
