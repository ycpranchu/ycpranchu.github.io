Cache vs Memory vs Storage
---

Why Memory Hierarchy - Balance access time and cost.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
`OS execution time` is slower than memory accesses and faster than storage accesses.
</Callout>

- Get data from memory - CPU loads/stores.
- Get data from storage - Shall execute OS. 

### Data in Memory

`Process data` and some `file data (Page Cache)` are both stored in the memory.

* For process data, CPU accesses them by using `load/store instructions`.
* For file data, CPU accesses them `by running the system call and I/O stacks`.

### What is Storage & Data

- What is data - A sequence of 0 and 1.
- What are storage/memory devices - Devices consist of material which can switch between 2 states (i.e., 0 and 1).

### I/O Devices & I/O Systems

Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)

- Cheaper per GB
- Reliability - Data will not loss

Solid-State Drives (SSDs)

- Faster Performance (No moving heads)
- No vibrations or noise
- Lighter and Smaller
- Support Random Access Better

Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
---

A hard disk has one or multiple platters.

- Each platter has 2 slides (`surfaces`).
- There is a `tiny distance` between the arm head and the surface. (`R/W by Magnetic`).
- Platters are bound together by a `spindle`.

Disk Performance (Without Optimizations) - `Seek_Time` + `Rotational_Delay` + `Transfer_Time`

- Seek Time: The time to move the disk arm to the `correct track` (Average: 4.9ms)
- Rotational Delay: `Rotate` the spindle to move the `desired sector` under the disk head.
- Transfer Time: The time to r/w data to the surface.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
HDDs take `longer time` to deal with `random accesses`.
</Callout>

### Deep Dive into the Read/Write Head

Direction of magnetic field (e.g., Anti-Parallel -> 1, Parallel -> 0)

* Read Head - Giant Magnetoresistance (GMR)
* Write Head - Inductive write

### Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR)

Why SMRs work - `Size difference` between the reader and writer.

- Sequential Write Constraint - Cannot directly update data in prior tracks. Shall `read out`, `modify` and `write` to a new track.

NAND Flash Based Solid State Drives (SSD)
---

- `NAND Flash memory` is a widely used `memory/storage technology`.
- `NOR Flash` is another technology for replacing the read-only memory (ROM) to `store BIOS` and `Firmware` (Faster random read). 

SSD - Channel -> Chip -> `Die (32 Gb)` -> Plane -> Block -> Pages -> Cell

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
1 Die = 2 * 1024 * 512 * 4KB = 4GB = 32Gb
</Callout>

- `Flash memory cells` on the `same wordline` are belonging to `a flash page`.

### NAND-Flash Cell

Each cell can store 1-bit or n-bits data.

How to store data - The value of `each data bit` is stored in a floating-gate.
> (Bit 0 -> with electrons, Bit 1 -> without electrons)

- Program (or Write) - Push electrons from P-substrate into the floating gate.
- Read - Check the `current value` between n-source and n-drain.

### How NAND-Flash Cell Works

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJNP8ej46.png)

- Read/Write Granularity - Flash page (4KB ~ 16KB)
- Erase Granularity - A block comprises a lot of Flash Pages (512)
> Erase unit > Write unit, shall follow the sequential write constraint.

### Multi-Level Cells

* Single-Level Cell (SLC) - One-bit per cell
* Multi-Level Cell (MLC) - Multiple-bits per cell, 2^#bits voltage levels

### Wear Outs & Retention Errors

A cell `cannot permanently retain` electrons, electrons escape over time.
> Pattern: 00 -> 01 or 01 -> 10

### SSD’s Architecture

* `Sequential Write Constraint` - Sol: Address Remapping (Logical Block Address to Physical Block Address) + Garbage Collection
* `Limited Lifetime` - Sol: Wear Leveling

`Memory Technology Device (MTD)` - Interact (read/program) with NAND Flash chips.

Clarifications

- `Leakage power` - power consumed even when it's not actively performing any computation or operations
- `Dynamic power` - power consumed during active operations or when it's switching states
