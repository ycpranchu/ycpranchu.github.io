What is a Process
---

### Task Lists & Process Descriptor

* `Process` 
> an active program and related resources.
* `Task Lists`
> A list of process descriptors in a circular doubly linked lists.
* `Process Descriptor (task_struct)`
> Contains all information about a process.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
In Linux, XXX Descriptor `means the data structure` for maintaining information for XXX.
</Callout>

- `Process Control Block` (A general name) = Process Descriptor (Linux, task_struct)
- `Max PID` = size of unsigned short int = `65,536` (16bits) 

### How Kernel accesses a Process Descriptor

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
A `thread_info` is stored at the `bottom of the kernel stack (4KB)`. (Easier to Access)
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
`Dereferences` the task member of `thread_info` to `get the pointer of the task_struct`.
</Callout>

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJqH2FB-p.png)

### Process State

* `Task_Running` - **Runnable**, either running or on a run-queue. (The only state for a process executing in user-space)
* `Task_Interruptible` - **Sleeping** (i.e., blocked), waiting for some condition.
* `Task_Uniterruptible` - **Sleeping, does not wake up** even receives a signal. (Kernel thread will manage it periodically. Fork Process.)
* `__Task_Stopped` - Execution has stopped. (SIGCONT to resume)
* `__Task_Traced` - Traced by another process (e.g., Debugger such as **GDB**).

### The Process Family Tree

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Use the `parent` or the `children` pointer provided by the process descriptor (parent may have multiple children).
</Callout>

By `traversing` through the `task_list` to access other processes.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1jlUh8gp.png)

### Process Creation

Process Creation = `fork() + exec()`

- fork()
> Create a child by copying its parent.
(Reason: efficient and simple!) 
- exec()
> Loads a new executable into the address space (i.e., memory) and runs it.

### Copy-on-Write (CoW)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
`Delay` and prevent copying data `until the data is written`.
</Callout>

Linux Implementation - `copy_process()`

- Allocate a new kernel stack (e.g., thread_info) and process descriptor (i.e., task_struct)
- Copy (e.g., program counter, states) or set (e.g., `PID`) fields in the process descriptor
- Set the state field to `TASK_UNINTERRUPTABLE` (Reason: initialization is non-interruptible)
- Duplicate parent’s `page table`
- `Duplicate (Process) or Share (Thread)`: Open files, filesystem information, signal handlers, process address space *(Notice: Does not share Stack)*, and namespace

### Process vs Thread

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Thread (Lightweight Process): Executes `within the same program` in a `shared memory address space` (also share open files and page tables).
</Callout>

* Linux implements all threads as `standard processes`.
(Have their own task_struct)
* Threads `have` their own: (1) Program Counter, (2) Registers, (3) Stack, (4) State 
(others are shared)
* Linux `does not` provide any special scheduling or data structures to represent threads.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Creating Threads: `clone() is identical to fork()`, except that shared:
</Callout>

1. the address space
1. file system resources
1. file descriptors
1. signal handlers

* Kernel Threads: Run kernel tasks in the background `(daemon)`
> do not have an address space
> & operating only in kernel-space 
- User Threads = Pthread Library

### Process Termination

1. Termination occurs when the process or C compiler calls `exit()`.
1. Sets the `PF_EXITING flag` in the flags member of the `task_struct`.
1. Call `exit_mm()` to `release the mm_struct (address space)` held by this process.
1. Call `exit_sem()` dequeued from an `IPC semaphore waiting queue`.
1. Call `exit_files()` and `exit_fs()` to `decrement the usage count` of objects related to file descriptors and filesystem data, respectively.
`decrement`, not delete, because of shared filesystem.
3. Call `exit_notify()` to `send signals to the task’s parent, reparents` any of the task’s children to another thread in their thread group or the init process.
4. Call `schedule()` to switch to a new process.
5. After the `parent retrieves the information`, the process's `kernel stack` (including task_struct and thread_info) will be `deallocated`.

Process Scheduling

### Multitacking Systems

Criteria for Schedulers: `Fairness`, `Response Time` (Interactive), `Throughput`

- `Cooperative`
> Processes voluntarily yield CPU. (high-priority can't preempt)
- `Preemptive`
> Involuntarily suspend (context switch) a running process.
- `Timeslice`
> The time a process runs before it is preempted (limit the usage of high-priority)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJx7g5qxp.png)

### Considerations for Designing Policies

Process Priority:

- `nice value` - larger value means lower priority, for normal processes
- `minus` nice value - higher priority (e.g. user process)
- `real-time value` - all real-time processes have higher priority than normal processes (0~99 labels)

Timeslice (static mapping) - limit the usage of high priority: 

- Longer timeslice - Better Resource Utilization

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Challenge 1 - Triggers context switch frequently if all processes are low priority.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Challenge 2 - Timeslice difference is huge for processes with higher nice value (lower priority)
</Callout>

> 2X Timeslice for nice value 18 and nice value 19 - Resource Unbalance
- `CFS` can solve these challenges, but O(1) cannot.

Process Characteristics:

- I/O-Bound - Spends much of time `submitting and waiting on I/O requests`.
> Policy: Run more frequently and interactive, shorter timeslice
* Processor-Bound - Spends much of time `executing code`.
> Policy: Run less frequently, longer timeslice

Maintenance Overhead:

* How to find the next process: (1) Queue (2) Tree (3) Bit-map
* Global runqueue `(maintain priority but Lock)` or Per-processor runqueue (Processor's utilization)

### Realtime Scheduling Policies

- `Soft Realtime` - kernel `tries` to schedule applications within timing deadlines. (Linux only provides soft realtime)
- `Hard Realtime` - systems are `guaranteed` to meet any scheduling requirements within certain limits. (Autopilot)

Linux Realtime Scheduling Policies:

- Priority Range: `0~99 (Realtime Processes)`, `100~139 (Normal Processes)`
    - `FIFO (SCHED_FIFO)` - simple
    - `Round-Robin (SCHED_RR)` - FIFO with timeslice
    > A lower-priority process can **never** preempt a SCHED_RR task, even if its timeslice is exhausted.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
`FIFO & Round-Robin` can run together
</Callout>

Linux Process Scheduler

### O(N) (simple)

- share a `global runqueue`, sorted by priority
- Bad: shall `lock` the runqueue, once only a process can access
- Bad: processes shall be `inserted` to an expired queue (out of running time) `in order, hard to scale`

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Want to solve - `Lock`.
</Callout>

### O(1) (Fast)

- `active array (bitmap)`, 0~139 high to low priority (40 nice-value + 100 real-value)
- `Hardware support` to find the leftmost bit.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJjgxpoe6.png)

- Use the `priority value` to `get (dequeue) the next process (FIFO)` 
- In the active array - `share the same priority`

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkCwW5rZa.png)

- `Recalculate priority` and enqueue to the expired bitarray.
- `expired bitarray` - when processes use all the timeslice, put into the expired array.
- When `no bit is set` in active bitarray, `switch active and expired bitarrays`.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Want to solve - `Low priority processes will not have the usage to CPU`.
</Callout>

### CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler)

* Goal - more interactive and more `Fair` than O(1).
* Concept
    * (1) Instead of statically mapping timeslice, each process would receive `1/n of the processor's time` (fair share)
    * (2) Schedule processes for `infinitely small durations`
* Complexity - log(n) // RB-tree

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyXNf5S-T.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
`No guarantee` - high-priority processes run earlier than lower-priority processes!
</Callout>

---

`Virtual Runtime` = Real system running time + Priority (Actual_Runtime/Weight)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Vruntime = delta_exec() * `NICE_Weight/NICE_k_Weight`
</Callout>

* `delta_exec` - Period to enter scheduler (e.g.,  6ms or 0.75ms, a constant)
* `NICE_Weight` - Weight for the corresponding nice value (e.g., 0 -> 1024)
* `NICE_k_Weight` - Overall weights of the all k running processes
* Keep the virtual runtime of all `running` processes the same

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1QdpZTeT.png)

* Goal: Be more interactive and `Fair` than O(1).
* How to decide the weight? 
    * Ans: Follow the 10% effect

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Update: NewVtime = OldVtime + `Actual_Runtime/Weight`
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
`Actual_Runtime` smaller, `NewVtime` nicer
</Callout>
