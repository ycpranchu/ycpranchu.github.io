IC Design Considerations
---

Several conflicting considerations:

- **Design Complexity:** large number of devices/transistors
- **Performance:** optimization requirements for high performance
- **Time-to-market:** about a 15% gain for early birds
- **Cost:** die area, packaging, testing, etc.
- **Others:** power, signal integrity (noise, etc.), testability, reliability, manufacturability, etc

ppay: power, performance, area, field

Traditional VLSI Design Cycles
---

1. System specification
2. Functional design -> Verilog
3. Logic synthesis
4. Circuit design
5. **Physical design (PDA, EDA)**
6. Fabrication 
7. Packaging

將數個功能不同的晶片，整合成「一個」具有完整功能的晶片，再封裝成「一個」積體電路，稱為「系統單晶片」（**SoC：System on a Chip**）

### Physical design cycle

1. Partitioning
2. Floorplanning
3. Placement
4. Routing
5. Post-layout optimization (buffering, sizing, etc.)
