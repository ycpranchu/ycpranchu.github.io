Partitioning

### Basic Definitions in Physical Design

* `Cell` - a logic block (gates)
* `Pin` - a wire
* `Nets` - a collection of pins
* `Netlist` - a list of all nets

### Basic Definitions in Physical Design

* `Manhattan distance`
* Rectilinear spanning tree O(N) vs. `Steiner tree (NP-Hard)`
* `Steiner tree` - with Steiner points

### What is Partitioning?

1. Decomposition of complex system into smaller subsystems.
2. Each subsysem will be designed `independently`.
> minimize the interconnections among the subsystems
3. Decompose until each subsystem is a managable size.

* The levels of partitioning: `system, board, chip`.
* Hierarchical partitioning: higher costs for higher levels.

### Circuit Partitioning

\# of connections among the components is minimized -> `independent`

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
Find minimal Cut Size.
</Callout>

### Problem Definition: Partitioning

- `k-way partitioning` - Given a graph G(V, E), problem is to divide the set V into k disjoint subsets, E has weight.
- `Bounded size constraint`
- `Min-cut cost between two subsets`

`2-way, balanced` partitioning problem is NP-complete

Kernighan-Lin Algorithm
---

An `iterative`, `2-way`, `balanced` partitioning (bi-sectioning) heuristic.

Till the cut size keeps decreasing
* Vertex pairs which give `the largest decrease or the smallest increase` in cut size are `exchanged`.
* These vertices are then `locked` (and thus are prohibited from participating in any further exchanges).
* This process `continues until all the vertices are locked`.
* Find the set with the `largest partial sum` for swapping.
* Unlock all vertices.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
largest partial sum -> max cost reduction = min cut-cost
</Callout>

### Properties

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy-L3VtgT.png)

- `External cost` - # of connections to other side partition
- `Internal cost` - # of connections to current side partition
- `Gain` = E - I

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
-2Cab: swap(a, b) 不影響 cost，減去多餘
</Callout>

### Time Complexity of K-L Algorithm

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkkVkBYx6.png)

* Line 4: Initial computation of D: O(n2).
* Line 5: The for-loop: O(n).
* The body of the loop: O(n2).
* Lines 4--11: Each pass of the repeat loop: O(n3).
* Suppose the repeat loop terminates after r passes.
* The total running time: `O(rn3)`.

### Extensions of K-L Algorithm

- `Unequal sized subsets`
> add n2-n1 dummy vertices to set A
- `Unequal sized “vertices”`
> assume smallest “vertex” has unit size, replace vertex size s with s vertices which are fully connected with infinite weight
- `k-way partition`

### Drawbacks of the Kernighan-Lin Heuristic

1. handles only unit vertex weights
2. handles only exact bisections
3. cannot handle `hypergraphs` (`edge to more than 2 vertexs`)
4. time complexity is high

`net cut` is a more accurate measurement for cut cost

### Net-Cut Model

Edge weight for an edge connecting cells x and y:

$$
\mathit{W_{xy}} =  
2
/
\mathit{n(i)}
$$

Easy `Gain` modification of the K-L heuristic:

- Weight = Origin / 2

Fiduccia-Mattheyses Heuristic
---

A linear time heuristic for improving network partitions

- Aims at `reducing net-cut costs`; the concept of cutsize is extended to hypergraphs.
- Only a `single vertex` is moved across the cut in a single move.
- `Vertices are weighted`.
- Can handle “unbalanced” partitions; a `balance factor` is introduced.
- A `special data structure` is used to select vertices to be moved across the cut to improve running time.
- `Time complexity O(P)`, where P is the total # of terminals.

### Updating Cell Gains

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIeadkGp.png)

#### Algorithm

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1zHTu1zT.png)

#### Complexity

To update the cell gains, it takes O(p(i)) work for cell i.

- Find the best cell i to move in O(1)
- After each move, update gain buckets in O(p(i))

`Total time = p(1) + p(2) + … + p(C) = O(P).`

### Analogy

### Basic Ingredients for Simulated Annealing

* Solution space
* Neighborhood structure
* Cost function
* Annealing schedule

#### 1. Solution space: set of all partitions

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H11jfKkG6.png)

#### 2. Neighborhood structure

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1YoMF1fa.png)

#### 3. Cost function: f = C + l B

* C: the partition cost as used before
* B: a measure of how balance the partition is
* l: a constant (l is bigger, B is more important)

#### 4. Annealing schedule

Based on `max-flow` `min-cut` theorem.

... (Not mention deeply in the class)

Large-scale Circuit Partitioning
---

Keys for large-scale circuits - `clustering`, `multilevel`

1. `Clustering` - Reduce the problem size by grouping highly connected components and treat them as a super node. (cut down the problem size -> speed up)
2. `Multilevel optimization`
    - `Coarsening/clustering` - Recursively clusters the instance until its size is smaller than a given threshold.
    - `Uncoarsening/partitioning` - Declusters the instance while applying a partitioning refinement algorithm (e.g., F-M or greedy approach).
