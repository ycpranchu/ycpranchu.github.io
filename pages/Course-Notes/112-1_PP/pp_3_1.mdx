`Issues to be Addressed`

See that the use of cache memories can actually cause a shared-memory program to run more slowly.

Processes, Threads, and Pthreads
---

### Processes

Memory Layout of C Programs

### Threads

Thread, comes from the concept of "thread of control".

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk426csGT.png)

* (a) Three processes each with one thread
* (b) One process with three threads

### Processes vs Threads

### Pthreads

Pthread Operations

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hyp90qoMT.png)

Creation of Threads

#### pthread_create()

Creates a new thread to execute a specified thread function.

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkApCcjfp.png)

Example - Creation of 2 Threads

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkZG1ijzT.png)

#### pthread_join()

Wait for the thread associated with the pthread_tobject to complete.

#### Creating and Joining Threads

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkTA1jsfT.png)
> Threads not joined are called detached threads.

### Thread Attributes

`Detached state` is one thread attribute which is not joinable and will release the resources.

A thread may be created as a:

- `joinable` thread (the default)
> When it terminates, its exit state is still kept in the system until another thread calls pthread_join() to obtain its return value.
- `detached` thread
> Its exit state is cleaned up automatically when it terminates.

Compilation

Compilation (add `-lpthread`)

```bash
$ gcc -o pth_hello pth_hello.c -lpthread
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
+= operator is not atomatic - race condition
</Callout>

### Using Busy-Waiting

An `optimizing compiler` might therefore determine that the program would make better use of registers if the order of the statements were switched.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Problem - If thread 0 is delayed, thread 1 will simply “spin” on the test, eating up CPU cycles.
</Callout>

### Mutex

The Pthreads standard includes a special type for mutexes - `pthread_mutex_t`
> It's a system call.

### Busy-Wait vs Mutex

- Performance - Each thread only enters the critical section once.
- Adaptability - Busy-waiting will execute the code in the critical section `ordered`.
> Since matrix multiplication isn’t commutative, our mutex solution would have problems

T0 will acquire the lock and continue to dereferencing a null pointer.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Have ownership mechanism.

### Semaphores

Barriers
---

No thread can proceed beyond the barrier until all the threads have reached it.
> Report the time taken by the last thread to finish, that is, the “slowest” thread.

- Determine where an error is occurring in a parallel program.

### Using Busy-Waiting

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry73wl2MT.png)

Some other thread may `enter the second barrier` before counter is reset and its increment to the counter will be lost.

### Using Semaphores

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rksk_gnGT.png)

However, `reusing barrier_sem` results in a race condition.

### Using a Condition Variable

A `condition variable` is a data object that allows a thread to suspend execution until a certain event or condition occurs.
> Condition occurs, another thread can signal the thread to “wake up”.
